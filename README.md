## 🧨 Kenya's Economic Exclusion Trap

> ❗ **80% of Kenyans lack access to wealth-building opportunities.**

A self-reinforcing cycle traps millions:

➡️ **Systemic Exclusion**  
➡️ **Stunted GDP Growth** *(40% youth unemployment)*  
➡️ **Government Debt Dependency** *(70% of tax revenue services loans)*  
➡️ **Taxation Squeeze** *(High interest + inflation)*  
➡️ **Widening Inequality** — and the cycle restarts.

| 🧊 **Liquidity Freeze** | Trillions in idle land & real estate |
| 🚪 **Access Fortress** | Elites dominate complex investment systems |
| 🕳️ **Trust Vacuum** | Rampant opacity, corruption, and broken systems |
